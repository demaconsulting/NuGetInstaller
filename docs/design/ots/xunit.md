## xUnit OTS Design

xUnit is the .NET unit-testing framework used by the NuGet Installer test project. It provides
test discovery, execution, and result reporting including TRX output for requirements
traceability.

### Purpose

xUnit discovers the test methods declared in the test project, executes them, and reports
pass/fail results. The `xunit.runner.visualstudio` adapter generates TRX result files that
ReqStream consumes to verify requirements coverage. Passing tests provide continuous
traceability evidence that the NuGet Installer's functional requirements are implemented
correctly.

xUnit is chosen because it provides a modern, self-contained test runner with
`OutputType: Exe` support for .NET 8/9/10, strong assertion APIs, and the
`xunit.runner.visualstudio` adapter for the TRX output format that ReqStream requires.

### Features Used

- Test discovery and execution of methods annotated with the `[Fact]` and `[Theory]`
  attributes.
- The xUnit assertion library (`Assert.Equal`, `Assert.True`, `Assert.Throws`, etc.) used
  throughout the test methods.
- The `[Collection]` attribute to serialize tests that share temporary file-system state.
- TRX result-file generation through the `xunit.runner.visualstudio` adapter, driven by
  `dotnet test --logger trx;LogFileName=<name>.trx`, for ReqStream consumption.

### Integration Pattern

xUnit is integrated via NuGet package references in the test project
(`DemaConsulting.NuGetInstaller.Tests.csproj`):

- `xunit.v3` — the core test framework providing `[Fact]`, `[Theory]`, assertions, and the
  test runner infrastructure for .NET 8, 9, and 10.
- `xunit.runner.visualstudio` — the Visual Studio and `dotnet test` adapter that enables TRX
  result file output.
- `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` — the test SDK integration layer required by the VSTest/`dotnet
  test` host for discovery.

The test project is configured with `OutputType: Exe` (required for xUnit's self-contained
test executables), `IsTestProject: true` (marks the project for MSBuild and the .NET test
SDK), and `TreatWarningsAsErrors: true`. No `xunit.runner.json` file is required; default
discovery and execution settings are used. Tests target `net8.0`, `net9.0`, and `net10.0`,
matching the supported runtime targets of the main project, and are executed with
`dotnet test --logger trx;LogFileName=<name>.trx` to produce TRX files for ReqStream.

xUnit and its runner are confined to the test assembly by the test project boundary: the
test project references the production project, but the production
`DemaConsulting.NuGetInstaller` project and its published NuGet package never reference the
test project, so the xUnit packages cannot flow to production consumers. This confinement is
a consequence of the dependency direction between the projects, not of any `PrivateAssets`
markup on the package references.
